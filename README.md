Alright cool so far we need the following:
Sounds/music added in
Transitional stages where we are flying in space and land on a planet
a script that allows us to add layers to music I kinda have a script like it but it needs adjusting
A title screen which I can do in a minute or too, a Win state that leads to a win screen then we will have a working game loop
add the rest of the sprites in like th ship flying, other tiles, the fuel, the plants/fruit
and that would be it I think its we can do it especially if we hand make the planets instead of random generation, add a timer to the flying through space and when the timer runs out load the next scene which would be a planet
